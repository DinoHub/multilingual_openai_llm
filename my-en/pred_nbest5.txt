When a small group of life (such as moving to a mountain or river, or when moving to a new island, they can't easily be recycled) is found to be in a new environment where they were not previously inhabited.
Because the new environment has different resources and different competitors, the new population will need different features, or they will need to adapt to be a stronger competitor than before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, and we still need to adapt as before.
Over time, a new population has become compatible with their new environment, and they are gradually becoming very different from other populations.
After thousands or millions of years, the two populations will become very different, even though they can't be called the same species.
This process is called seed generation, which means identifying new species. Seed generation is an inevitable consequence and a very important component of change.

Everybody participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone is confused about transportation systems.
In developed countries, it is difficult to hear the same complaints about water quality or the breakdown of bridges.
Why are transport systems complaining about this, and why can't we do the daily tasks? Is it because of the inability of transport engineers? Or is there a fundamental reason?
Traffic Flow is the study of how drivers and vehicles communicate from one place to another.
Unfortunately, it can't predict the driver's behavior for a hundred percent, and it's difficult to track traffic flow.
Fortunately, because drivers act at the right rate, their movements may be naturally consistent and mathematically rough.
